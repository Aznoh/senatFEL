<p>CTU is the premiere national technical research university and ranks
121<sup>st</sup> worldwide in the Engineering &amp; IT category of the 2011 <a
href='http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/czech-technical-university-prague/wur'>THES

in Central Europe, the University with 8 faculties and more than 24 000 students
enrolled plays the key role in technical education in the Czech Republic.</p>
